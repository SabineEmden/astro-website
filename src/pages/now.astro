  <h2>Web Development</h2>
	<p>
		My main focus is learning web development with <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. I'm on the Full Stack JavaScript learning path and wrapping up the course <cite>Intermediate HTML & CSS</cite> with <cite>Project: Admin Dashboard</cite>. The next course is <cite>JavaScript</cite>.
	</p>
	<p>
		For additional coding practice, I'm working on the learning path <cite>Building responsive layouts</cite> on <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontend Mentor</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a side project, I'm building this website with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>. You can read more about it in the <a href="/colophon">Colophon</a>. I'm working on getting a basic version up and running. Next is connecting a Content Management System (<abbr>CMS</abbr>).
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the reasons why I'm building this website is to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public">learn in public</a> by sharing notes and articles. I'm doing some writing for that.
	</p>
	<p>
		My interest in web sustainability is on the back burner. I'm reading <cite>What If We Get It Right?</cite> by Ayana Elizabeth Johnson and listening to a couple of podcasts on climate action and green software.

  <h2>Leisure</h2>
  <p>
    To get away from my computer, I decided to get back into running. I'm training for a 5K race (3.16 miles) in mid December. The best way for me to stick to a regular exercise routine is to train for a race.
  </p>
  <p>
    My leisure reading project is the <a href="https://www.bookmarksnc.org/passport">Literary Passport</a> by Bookmarks, a nonprofit and independent bookstore in Winston-Salem, NC. The goal is to read one book from each country in the world. I'm reading <cite>Our Share of Night</cite> by Mariana Enriquez. It's book two of twelve for South America.
