My main focus is **learning web development** with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I'm on the Full Stack JavaScript learning path and wrapping up the course _Intermediate HTML & CSS_ with _Project: Admin Dashboard_. The next course is _JavaScript_.

For **additional coding practice**, I'm working on the learning path _Building responsive layouts_ on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

As a side project, I'm **building this website** with [Astro](https://astro.build/). You can read more about it in the [Colophon](/colophon). Now that I have a basic version up and running, I'm working on connecting a Content Management System (CMS).

One of the reasons why I'm building this website is to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) by sharing notes and articles. I need to do some **writing** for that.

My interest in **web sustainability** is on the back burner. I'm reading _What If We Get It Right?: Visions of Climate Futures_ by Ayana Elizabeth Johnson and listening to a couple of podcasts on climate action and green software.

To get away from my computer, I decided to **get back into running**. I'm training for a 5K race (3.16 miles) in mid December. The best way for me to stick to a regular exercise routine is to train for a race.

My leisure reading project is the [Literary Passport](https://www.bookmarksnc.org/passport) by Bookmarks, a nonprofit and independent bookstore in Winston-Salem, NC. The goals is to **read one book from each country in the world**. I'm reading _Our Share of Night_ by Mariana Enriquez. It's book two out of twelve for South America.
