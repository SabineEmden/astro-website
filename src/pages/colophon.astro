  <p>
    This website is powered by Astro, GitHub, and Netlify, and based on the
    official <a href="https://astro.build/themes/details/blog/">Astro Blog</a> template.
    I customized the template to my needs and made a few changes to improve responsiveness
    and accessibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    I replaced the blog posts with two content collections, one for notes and
    one for articles. Notes are shorter than articles and less polished. My plan
    is to grow the notes collection into a <a
      href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">digital garden</a
    >. Articles are the kind of content I might share on LinkedIn.
  </p>

  <p>
    Following web sustainability best practices, I decided limit the use of
    decorative images and removed the hero images from notes and articles. I
    still include images for sharing content on social media with <a
      href="https://seosetups.com/blog/open-graph/">Open Graph</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    The font family is <a href="https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/"
      >Atkinson Hyperlegible</a
    >. It was developed by the Braille Institure of America to help low-vision
    readers, is licensed under the <a href="https://openfontlicense.org/"
      >Open Font License</a
    >, and free for personal and commercial use. The font familiy came with the
    Astro Blog template, as did the color palette and the SEO features.
