			<h1>üë©‚Äçüíª Hello, I'm Sabine! </h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to my personal website! I'm a self-taught web developer from Germany, living in the southeastern United States.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm building this website with the official <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> blog starter template. This
				template serves as a lightweight, minimally-styled starting point for anyone looking to build
				a personal website, blog, or portfolio with Astro.
			</p>
			<p>
				This site is still under construction and a work in progress. Come back soon to see what's new!
