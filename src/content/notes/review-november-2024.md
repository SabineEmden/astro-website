## Recap

This month, I created 1 new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/SabineEmden) and made 48 commits across 3 repositories:

- 28 commits to my personal website,
- 10 commits to my solution for the Frontend Mentor challenge <cite>product preview card component</cite>,
- 10 commits to <cite>Project: Admin Dashboard</cite> in The Odin Project.

## Highs

I made good progress with my [personal website](/). I have a basic version up and running, have added my custom domain, and can publish notes and articles on the site. I have three notes published so far. This monthly review will be the fourth.

I published a list of [Digital Sustainability Resources for Web Developers](/notes/digital-sustainability-resources/) on my personal website. I plan to add more resources to it over time.

## Lows

I didn't make much progress on <cite>Project: Admin Dashboard</cite> in The Odin Project and therefore still haven't completed the course <cite>Intermediate HTML & CSS</cite>.

I didn't make much progress on the learning path <cite>Building Responsive Layouts</cite> on Frontend Mentor either. I started the challenge <cite>product preview card component</cite> but haven't completed it yet.

I haven't written any articles for my personal website yet and still have the dummy content that came with the Astro Blog template on the site.

## Shout-outs

I had a lovely evening with the women of [Winston Women in STEM](https://www.meetup.com/winston-salem-women-in-stem/). A special shout-out to Maisie for founding the group over five years ago and for keeping it running.

## Looking Forward

Next month, I want to go back to making at least one commit every weekday and tracking the time I work on learning web development. I also want to take time off from web development from December 23rd through January 5th to look back on the current year and to plan for the next.
