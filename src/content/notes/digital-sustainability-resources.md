> If we wish to create web services that are good for people and the planet, we must take responsibility for the environmental impact of the work we do. This is what sustainable web design as a practice seeks to do.<br>
> â€” Tom Greenwood, <cite>Sustainable Web Design</cite>

## Books

- <cite>Sustainable Web Design</cite> by Tom Greenwood (2021). This book was the starting point of my education on digital sustainability.
- <cite>Design for the Real World</cite> by Victor Papanek (1971). I read this book in 2022, when I was exploring UX Design as a possible career path. Read this book if you are interested in the history of product design. And be warned: Some of its language is very outdated and now considered offensive.
- <cite>World Wide Waste</cite> by Gerry McGovern (2020). This book sits on my book shelf. I haven't read it yet.
- <cite>The Carbon Footprint of Everything</cite> by Mike Berners-Lee (2022). This book also sits on my book shelf, and I haven't read it yet.
- <cite>What If We Get It Right?</cite> by Ayana Elizabeth Johnson (2024). I started reading this book, but haven't finished it yet.

## Podcasts

- <cite>[Outrage + Optimism](https://www.outrageandoptimism.org/)</cite>, co-hosted by Christiana Figueres, Tom Rivett-Carnac, and Paul Dickinson. This podcast is a great way to keep up with the bigger picture of the climate crisis. It covers the latest news from science, business, finance, politics, and culture.
