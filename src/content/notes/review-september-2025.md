## Recap

My main focus was expanding my project management skills with the [Google Project Management: Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management), a series of seven courses on the online learning platform Coursera.

I took [Small Web September](../sws-kickoff) as inspiration to bring my personal website up to date. My main goal was to longer feel embarrassed about the state the website is in.

My fitness goal was to train for a three-day hike on the [Moselsteig Trail](https://en.visitmosel.de/hiking) in mid October.

## Highs

I completed the third course, [Project Planning: Putting It All Together](https://coursera.org/share/d8a8645c69370a6c666632446bfa8403), for the Google Project Management Certificate

[Humbled Warriors Yoga](https://humbledwarriorsyoga.com/) in High Point added Pilates to their regular schedule. My Saturday mornings now start with a 45-minute Pilates workout followed by a 60-minute yoga class.

## Lows

I reached some of my goals for Small Web September but not all of them. Most importantly, I failed to publish at least two articles on my personal website. That means I still have only dummy content in the [Articles](../../articles) section.

I'm no longer attending Greensboro Running Club's Tuesday night group runs. The club moved their weekly runs to a new location, and the drive is too long for me. I decided not to look for a new running club at this point.

## Shout-outs

Grace McFetters is a local fiber artist and my running buddy. I took Grace's class Taste of Art: Punch Needle at [Sawtooth School for Visual Arts](https://sawtooth.org/) in Winston-Salem on September 5th.

## Looking Forward

My goals for October 2025 are to completed the fourth and fifth course for the Google Project Management Certificate, [Project Execution: Running the Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-execution-google) and [Agile Project Management](https://www.coursera.org/learn/agile-project-management) by October 10th and publish two articles on my personal website by October 15th. I'm also looking forward to my hiking trip to the Moselle valley.
