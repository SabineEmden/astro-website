  <!-- The Odin Project -->
  <p>
    My main focus is learning web development with <a
      href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a
    >. I'm on the <cite>Full Stack JavaScript</cite> learning path and wrapping up
    the course <cite>Intermediate HTML & CSS</cite> with <cite
      >Project: Admin Dashboard</cite
    >. The next course is <cite>JavaScript</cite>.
  </p>
  <!-- Frontend Mentor -->
  <p>
    For additional coding practice, I'm working on the learning path <cite
      >Building Responsive Layouts</cite
    > on <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontend Mentor</a>. You can
    find my solutions and the feedback I gave to others on my <a
      href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/SabineEmden"
      >Frontend Mentor profile</a
    >.
  </p>
  <!-- Astro Website -->
  <p>
    As a side project, I'm building <a href="/">my personal website</a> with <a
      href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a
    >. You can read more about it in the <a href="/colophon">Colophon</a>. I
    have a basic version up and running. My next goal is to connect a Content
    Management System (<abbr>CMS</abbr>).
  </p>
  <!-- Learning in Public -->
  <p>
    One of the reasons why I'm building my website is to <a
      href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public">learn in public</a
    > by publishing <a href="/notes">notes</a> and <a href="/articles"
      >articles</a
    >. I've published a few notes, but haven't written any articles yet. Other
    places where I share what I learned are the READMEs for the projects on my <a
      href="https://github.com/SabineEmden">GitHub profile</a
    > and my <a href="https://mastodon.online/@sabineemden"
      >profile on Mastodon</a
    >.
  </p>
  <!-- Job Search -->
  <p>
    To prepare for my job search, I'm reviewing my online presence, cleaning it
    up where necessary, and updating my social media profiles.
  </p>

  <!-- Web Sustainability -->
  <p>
    My interest in web sustainability is on the back burner. I'm listening to a
    couple of podcasts on climate action and green software. For a list of
    resources see my note <a href="/notes/digital-sustainability-resources/"
      >Digital Sustainability Resources for Web Developers</a
    >.
  </p>
  <!-- Running -->
  <p>
    To get away from my computer occasionally, I decided to get back into
    running. I'm training for a 5K race (3.16 miles) in mid December. To train
    for a race is the best way for me to stick to a regular exercise routine.
  </p>
  <!-- Literary Passport -->
  <p>
    My leisure reading project is the <a
      href="https://www.bookmarksnc.org/passport">Literary Passport</a
    > by Bookmarks, a nonprofit and independent bookstore in Winston-Salem, NC. The
    goal is to read one book from each country in the world. I'm reading <cite
      >Our Share of Night</cite
    > by Mariana Enriquez. It's book two of twelve for South America.
