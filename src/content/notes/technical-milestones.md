In her book <cite>You Belong in Tech</cite>, Anna Jean McDougall provides a list of questions for aspiring web developers to assess if they are ready to start applying to junior positions and internships. I'm using this list here to track my job readiness.

If you want to know what I'm working on right now, please see my [Now page](/now).

## General skills

### Can you build a project without referring to a tutorial? (Search engines are OK!)

**Yes, I can.** Building projects without referring to a tutorial is an important part of both The Odin Project and Frontend Mentor.

You can find the projects I've built on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/SabineEmden).

### Can you explain that code to someone else?

**Yes, I can.** I explain some of my code in the READMEs that are included in the GitHub repositories for my projects, in the solution retrospectives on Frontend Mentor, and in my response to community feedback. All of this is in writing. I haven't had the opportunity yet to talk about my code.

You can find my GitHub repositories with their READMEs on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/SabineEmden) and my retrospectives to the solutions I submitted on Frontend Mentor on my [Frontend Mentor profile](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/SabineEmden) under _Solutions_.

### Can you look a another person's code and explain line-by-line what's happening? (Again, perhaps with some gaps for specific methods you're not familiar with.)

**Yes, I can.** For every solution I submit to a challenge on Frontend Mentor, I give at least one detailed code review to a community member who has solved the same project. This is in writing. I haven't had the opportunity yet to talk about another person's code.

You can find the code reviews I have given on my [Frontend Mentor profile](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/SabineEmden) under _Comments_.

### Can you reliably use Git to clone, push, branch, and pull code?

**Yes, I can.** I use Git and GitHub in all my web development projects, for version control and to share my code. I have also forked and cloned repositories with coding exercises that were part of the curriculum for The Odin Project. I have not used Git yet to work collaboratively with a team.

### Are you familiar with some of the terminology of clean code, such as DRY, KISS, or the Single Responsibility Principle?

**Yes, I am.** DRY stands for 'Don't Repeat Yourself'. It emphasizes the importance of avoiding code duplications. KISS stands for 'Keep It Simple, Stupid'. It prioritizes simple solutions over complex ones.

The Odin Project has a lesson on [Clean Code](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-clean-code) in the <cite>JavaScript Basics</cite> section of the <cite>Foundations Course</cite>, where I learned how to improve the readability of my code. The Single Responsibility Principle is covered in a lesson on [OOP Principles](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-oop-principles) in the <cite>JavaScript Course</cite>. I haven't reached that lesson yet.

## Front-end development

### Can you explain the difference between Flexbox and grid in CSS?

**Yes, I can.** Flexbox and Grid are both CSS layout methods.

### Have you used a CSS framework (eg Tailwind, Bootstrap, Material UI, etc)?

**No, not yet.** The Odin Project has a lesson on frameworks and preprocessors in the <cite>Intermediate CSS Concepts</cite> section of the <cite>Intermediate HTML and CSS Course</cite>.

### Can you send a GET request to an API and use the data it returns?

### Can you create a form and send the data in a POST request?

### Are you familiar with the basics of at least one front-end framework or library (eg Vue, React, Svelte, Angular, etc)?

## Back-end development

### Can you explain the difference between a controller and a service layer?

**No, not yet.**

### Can you set up a connection to a database?

**No, not yet.**

### Could you create a game in the console?

**No, not yet.**

### Can you explain what inheritance is?

**No, not yet.**

### Can you look at a database schema and explain the relationships between entities in simple terms?

**No, not yet.**
