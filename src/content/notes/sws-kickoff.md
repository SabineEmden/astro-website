I came across a [post](https://fandom.ink/@enchantedsleeper/115131021166817239) on Mastodon about Small Web September, a monthlong event encouraging participants to make progress on projects related to individual websites and small web services. It is hosted by [enchantedsleeper](https://enchantedsleeper.dreamwidth.org) in the [All Things Small Web](https://smallweb.dreamwidth.org/13854.html) community on Dreamwidth Studio. I take it as inspiration to work on my personal website during the month of September.

I've neglected my website for the last ten months and haven't updated it since early December 2024. That needs to change!

## Goals

My main goal is to feel confident about sharing links to my personal website and not feel embarrassed about the state it is in. Here is my task list:

- [ ] Update the [index](../../) page:
  - [ ] Write new copy for About section
  - [ ] Add a list of five most recent articles
- [x] Update the [Now](../../now) page
- [ ] Publish at two new articles
- [x] Update note on [technical milestones](../technical-milestones)
- [ ] Publish monthly review for September 2025

## Discussion Prompts

I don't plan to join the community on Dreamwidth Studio, where Small Web September is hosted. Instead, I will answer the discussion prompts here on my website:

- [x] Kick-off and goal-setting: _the note you are reading right now_
- [ ] Check-in 1: Links! (September 7th)
- [ ] Check-in 2: Halfway point! (September 14th)
- [ ] Check-in 3: Communities! (September 21st)
- [ ] Check-in 4: Wrap-up! (September 30th)
- [ ] "What inspired you to make (or start making) your small web project(s)?"
- [ ] "[W]hat is it that appeals to you about the small web?"

## Maybe Later

The following are improvements I'd like to make to my website that are out of scope for this year's Small Web September:

- Test RSS feeds and fix if necessary
- Change images for social media previews
- Set up FrontMatter CMS
- Subset font files
